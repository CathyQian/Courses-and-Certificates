### This repository contains all homework of for the online course Machine Learning on Coursera provided by Stanford University via Prof. Andrew Ng. This work was done July-Sep 2016 using Octave.

Given that most of the projects contains large chunks of code provided by the course provider, I am not permitted to put these projects online.
